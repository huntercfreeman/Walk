I teach C# and Blazor $100 an hour.
Email me: huntercfreeman@gmail.com

I'll teach it to companies so long as it won't get me in legal trouble.
I'm not sure the legality of consulting, but I'll get on a call with you at $100 an hour and help you with whatever you want as long as I won't get in legal trouble for doing so.

I mean you can honestly just email me anything you want.

You could email me a ":)" if you wanted.
