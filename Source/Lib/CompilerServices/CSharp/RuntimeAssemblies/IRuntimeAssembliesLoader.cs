///          Abstract <see cref="System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext"/> usage
///          to a single method invocation.<br/><br/>
///
///          This method invocation uses reflection to make a readonly
///          'cache' of the runtime types.<br/><br/>
///
///          The 'cache' is more so just a representation of the runtime types
///          as if the source code itself were passed to the <see cref="Walk.CompilerServices.CSharp.ParserCase.CSharpParser"/><br/><br/>
///
///          The idea is to create the 'cache' once per .NET version that a user requests to reference.
///          Then re-use the 'cache' until the application is closed.<br/><br/>
/// 
///          (re-creation of the cache would be done each time the application is opened.)<br/><br/>
